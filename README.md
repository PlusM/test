# Just trying a few things out here, no need to panic

Interesting to see how well markdown renders automatically in VSCode, particularly when I'm posting it to Github

* This is bullet 1
* This is bullet 2

**This is some bold text**

*This is some italicised text*

1. Item 1
2. Item 2


>blockquote like this
>and this 
>and this

Here's some code:

'<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">

    <title>Selection Function Chain</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../../css/styles.css"/>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="../../lib/d3.js"></script>
</head>'
